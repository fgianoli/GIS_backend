A container image is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package of a piece of software that includes everything needed to run it: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, settings.

Docker containers running on a single machine share that machineâ€™s operating system kernel; they start instantly and use less compute and RAM.

Containers can share a single kernel, and the only information that needs to be in a container image is the executable and its package dependencies, which never need to be installed on the host system.

Multiple containers can run on the same machine and share the OS kernel with other containers, each running as isolated processes in user space.
